# C-PASTE Prompt Architect

A privacy-focused, single-file web application for engineering structured prompts for LLMs (Gemini, GPT, Claude, etc.). Built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS, designed to run entirely in your browser using Local Storage.

## 📖 The Methodology: C-PASTE

This tool implements the **C-PASTE** framework to ensure consistent, high-quality AI outputs by structurally separating instructions:

- **C - Context / Persona**: Who is the AI acting as? (e.g., "Senior Python Engineer")
- **P - Purpose**: What is the high-level goal?
- **A - Audience**: Who is the output for?
- **S - Style**: Constraints, tone, and formatting (e.g., "JSON only", "No markdown")
- **T - Task**: Specific, actionable steps.
- **E - Examples**: Few-shot examples to eliminate hallucinations and enforce format.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔒 Privacy First:** Uses **Local Storage** exclusively. Your data never leaves your browser and is not stored in any cloud database.
- **⚡ Zero-Build Architecture:** The entire application is contained within `index.html`. No Node.js, NPM, or build steps required.
- **🧩 Smart Snippets:** Includes pre-built suggestions for specific domains (Coding vs. Creative Writing).
- **Variables System:** Type `{{variable_name}}` in your task to automatically generate dynamic input fields.
- **XML Compilation:** Automatically compiles your prompt using XML tags (e.g., `<context>...</context>`), which is the optimal format for modern LLMs.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Usage)

1.  Download the `index.html` file.
2.  Double-click it to open it in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.
3.  That's it! Your work will be saved automatically to your browser.

## 🌐 Deployment (Self-Hosted)

Since this is a static file, it can be hosted on any web server (Nginx, Apache, GitHub Pages, etc.).

### Caddy Configuration (e.g., Hostinger VPS)

1.  Upload `index.html` and `legal.html` to `/var/www/prompt-architect/`.
2.  Add this block to your `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`:

```caddy
prompts.yourdomain.com {
    root * /var/www/prompt-architect
    encode gzip
    file_server
}
```

3.  Reload Caddy: `sudo systemctl reload caddy`.
